The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a nested element might not produce the expected outcome due to the parent container's context.  Similarly, using `calc()` with units that don't mix properly (like `calc(10px + 2em)` which mixes absolute and relative units) will also cause issues. Another common mistake is forgetting the spaces around the operators within `calc()` like `calc(10px+20px)` which should be `calc(10px + 20px)` .
